Save your time, write with pleasure! Paste images from clipboard directly into the post editor!

== Description ==

<strong>Save tons of time when adding images into your posts! Write with pleasure, fill your lovely website with quality content!</strong>

Have you wondered how many steps you need to do for adding an image into a wordpress post? 
For example, a screen snapshot? Or a selection area from Photoshop? Or a photo somewhere on your hard disk?

We bet you could add images more often and make your content more attractive if it didnâ€™t take so many time! 
You should understand it if you write tutorials, reviews, news or just articles with a lot of photos.

Image Elevator for Wordpress allows you to paste images into the post editor directly from clipboard (or by dragging & dropping files)! 
In other words, you can paste images directly from your favorite graphical editors or from any screen capture programs. 

*The plugin is a free edition of the premium 
<a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/image-elevator-for-wordpress/4311188?ref=OnePress">Image Elevator</a> plugin
